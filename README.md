# HackatonAwesomneRandomness

This project was produced in 24hours during the 6# <Academia de Codigo_> Hackaton, on March 30th to March 31st.
The theme was to produce a product that had some kind of "random" behaviour. Our first idea was that the enemies would have 
a random behaviour upon their deaths. Couldn't really make it then, but managed to create a random movement. Random behaviour
for the enemies will be introduced later on.
Worked on Libgdx and Java.
